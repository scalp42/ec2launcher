An _environment_ describes a collection of instances that share common settings. Typical environments might include development, staging and production. In contrast, an _application_ represents a full application stack running on an EC2 instance. Launching a new instance combines the configurations from both an environment and an application.\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\nInstall the ec2launcher gem:\r\n\r\n`gem install ec2launcher`\r\n\r\nCreate a new workspace for environments and applications:\r\n\r\n`ec2launcher init myworkspace`\r\n\r\nThis creates a directory with the new `myworkspace` that contains a `config.rb`, an `environments` directory and an `applications` directory.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\n* [Installation](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/Installation)\r\n* [Environments](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/Environments)\r\n* [Applications](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/Applications)\r\n* [Launching Instances](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/Launching)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [Naming conventions](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/Naming-Conventions)\r\n* [Index of wiki pages](https://github.com/StudyBlue/ec2launcher/wiki/_pages)\r\n* [ec2launcher gem docs](http://rdoc.info/gems/ec2launcher)","tagline":"Shared scripts to launch EC2 instances"}
